#Objective: Run DESEQ2 on human data

#Raw data file path: /scratch/Shares/rinnclass/MASTER_CLASS/DATA/human_DOX

```{r library setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(IRanges)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(purrr)
library(magrittr)
library(pheatmap)
library(textshape)
library(Rcpp)
library(DESeq2)
library(tibble)
```

```{r loading and cleaning up count data}
# We need to make the function write to an output object. To do so we use the 
# <- assisgnement operator, here we are calling the salmon merged gene counts "counts_matrix"
# Then we will call the read.table() function that first requires a file path to the counts in quotes
# Note that in R functions follow with () where the parameter inputs are placed.
# Then we will call up different parameters with a comma, in this case header = TRUE, row.names =1
hDOX_counts <- read.table("/scratch/Shares/rinnclass/MASTER_CLASS/STUDENTS/genehomies/DATA/HUMAN/salmon.merged.gene_counts.tsv", header=TRUE, row.names=1)

# Nice, now we have an object called counts_matrix in our Environment Panel (top right)

# There are time points here that don't exist for mouse data, so these should be removed
hDOX_counts <- hDOX_counts %>%
  select(gene_name, gfp_0_1, gfp_0_2, gfp_0_3, gfp_12_1, gfp_12_2, gfp_12_3, gfp_24_1, gfp_24_2, gfp_24_3, gfp_48_1, gfp_48_2, gfp_48_3, gfp_96_1, gfp_96_2, gfp_96_3)

```

# 2) Making a dataframe of gene_id and gene_name
Now let's make a table of gene_id and gene_name from the first two columns of counts_matrix
The reason being that the gene_id is a unique identifying number and the gene_symbol is more intuitive name.
We will use this a lot throughout our analyses.

Note: that the gene_id is currently in a "meta" format so we need to move it into the table.
To do this we will use the rownames function
```{r create g2s object}

# Creating a dataframe with gene_id and gene_symbol
# note creating columns with name = data
g2s <- data.frame(gene_id = rownames(hDOX_counts), gene_symbol = hDOX_counts[ , 1])
#first value is rows, second value is commas in brackets

```


```{r loading up count data}
# The first two columns are gene_id and gene_name
# Those will be very handy let's make an object of these

g2s <- data.frame(
  gene_id = rownames(hDOX_counts),
  gene_name = hDOX_counts[, 1]
)

# Note that rows or columns in black are "meta" meaning not really part of the matrix - just a label of sorts
# Note that there is a column with characters for gene name - we want a pure number matrix, but can have meta labels.
# Let's remove the gene name column for now and we will bring it back later.

# removing gene names by indexing rows and columns via object[ rows, columns ]
hDOX_counts <- hDOX_counts %>% 
  select(-gene_name)

# turning into a matrix using as.matrix() function
hDOX_counts <- as.matrix(hDOX_counts) 

# Rounding the numbers with the round() function
hDOX_counts_rounded <-round(hDOX_counts)

# Note meta nature of cols and rows

```

```{R filtering counts to items greater than 1}

# Filtering so Deseq is not getting too many 0's for normalization
hDOX_counts_filtered <- hDOX_counts_rounded[rowSums(hDOX_counts_rounded) > 1, ]

## Check out values of counts_matrix and counts_filtered in Environment panel (top right)
# How many genes were filtered out by this indexing? Hint compare counts_matrix_rounded with counts_filtered

```

```{R colData file for DESEQ2}
# First we will create a dataframe from counts matrix that includes all the column names
# To do this we call the data.frame() function and inside make col called sample_id
# that is equal to the names of the columns in count matrix (e.g., WT_0_1)
human_deseq_samples <- data.frame(
  sample_id = colnames(hDOX_counts))

# There is good information in each sample_id and we can use code to separate out.
# First we will make an object called "split_values" to split sample_id by any underscore
# Note we are indexing into deseq_samples using '$' to denote index $column_name
# Note we use the function strsplit() to go into sample_id col and split at " _ "
split_values <- strsplit(human_deseq_samples$sample_id, "_")
```

# We just created a new dataframe to input our samples into DESEQ2
Note we used the sample_id to keep track of the original naming
This helps with reproducibility for tracking names across code.
Let's keep using this practice and get more sample info from sample_id

# 2) Learning Rfuncitons & indexing to retreive name info
```{R col file for DESEQ2}
# Now we are going to learn another key function "sapply()"
# This is essentially a built in for loop to go over all rows and perform the same function.
# So here we will go through each row of split_values and run a "generic function(x)" 
# We will then retain the second item which is the time point value in sample_id
time_values <- sapply(split_values, function(x) x[[2]])

# Similar to above we are using sapply to grab the third fragment in split_values
# after two breaks at each "_" there are three parts - here we are grabbing the 3rd 
# NOTE indexing the function of x, which number from the split to a specific number with [[ ]]
replicate_values <- sapply(split_values, function(x) x[[3]])

# Ok now we can do more indexing and make more columns in our deseq_samples dataframe!
# The $ can allow you to index into a specific column or even create a new one.
# so we are making a new column by adding $time_point onto deseq_sample. 
# Then we fill this column by using the assignment operator to place time points in
human_deseq_samples$time_point <- time_values

# Now let's add another column for replicate
human_deseq_samples$replicate <- replicate_values

```

# 3) Factoring columns
```{R factoring timepoint and replicate column}

human_deseq_samples$time_point <- factor(human_deseq_samples$time_point)
human_deseq_samples$replicate <- factor(human_deseq_samples$replicate)

```

# 4) Save the sample sheet
```{r saving sample sheet}

save(human_deseq_samples, file = "/scratch/Shares/rinnclass/MASTER_CLASS/STUDENTS/genehomies/RESULTS/HUMAN/human_deseq_samples.RData")

```

# (1) first run DESeq2 by creating a dds (DESEQ Data Structure) 
We use the function "DESeqDataSetFromMatrix"
With parameters of countData, colData, design

dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = hDOX_counts_filtered,
                              # this is our counts data we read in
                              colData = human_deseq_samples,
                              # telling DeSeq what env variable to use for sample sheet
                              design = ~ time_point)
                              # perhaps most important is "condition" is a factor in deseq_samples
                              # we will be using time_point
                              
# Ok let's make a dds !

```{r run DEseq Data Set From Matrix }

dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = hDOX_counts_filtered,
                              colData = human_deseq_samples,
                              design = ~ time_point)
```

# Now run DESeq function that does all the magic !
```{r run DEseqDataSetFromMatrix }

dds <- DESeq(dds)

```

```{r results}

# resultsNames function retreives names of results
resultsNames(dds)

# Nice we see this output:
# "Intercept" "time_point_12_vs_0" "time_point_24_vs_0" "time_point_48_vs_0" "time_point_96_vs_0"
# DESEQ found genes differential expression values for each time point relative to 0 time point.

```

#  Normalize counts (rlog function)
This basically is rank counts normalized to std error in replicates.
```{r rlog }
rlog_counts <- rlog(dds, blind = TRUE)
```

# now we retrieve the values using the "assay" function that converts to rlog_counts
```{r}
rlog_counts_matrix <- assay(rlog_counts)

```

# Finally, let's save this rlog matrix to use in our future analyses and plotting.
We will save this as R Data Structure .rds -- this will keep the object stored properly
to be loaded into the environment to use for downstream analyses.

```{r}

write_rds(rlog_counts_matrix, "/scratch/Shares/rinnclass/MASTER_CLASS/STUDENTS/genehomies/RESULTS/HUMAN/rlog_counts_hDOX.rds")

```

```{r turn the counts matrix into integer}

hDOX_counts_integer <- round(hDOX_counts)

```

```{r checking that sample sheet and counts match rows and cols respectively}

# Check ordering

stopifnot(all(colnames(hDOX_counts_integer) == rownames(human_deseq_samples$sample_id)))

# Nice our columns in the counts are the same as rows in sample_id

```

# 5 Compile all results 0-vs-12, 0-vs-24, 0-vs-48, 0-vs-96
First we are going to make a datframe structure to store the results
# Note this is a common strategy before a for-loop : make file to populate

```{r viewing results and making a data frame to compile all results from each time}

# Let's find the names of the results we want
result_names <- resultsNames(dds)

# Let's get rid of intercept
results_names <- result_names[-1]

# Now the empty data frame with values we want to grab from results

res_df <- data.frame("gene_id" = character(), 
                     "baseMean" = numeric(), 
                     "log2FoldChange" = numeric(), 
                     "lfcSE" = numeric(),
                     "stat" = numeric(),
                     "pvalue" = numeric(),
                     "padj" = numeric(),
                     "gene_name" = character(),
                     "result_name" = character())


```

# 6 FOR-LOOP: for-loop to put the values for each time point analysis
```{r Learning for-loops to compile all results from all time points}

# Let's figure out each step - for loops are common practice so let's get to know them

for(i in 1:length(results_names)) {
  # grabbing the result name for i in for loop - will repeat for all result names
  results_name <- results_names[i]
  # grabbing the results using DESEQ2 results function for time point i
  res <- results(dds, name = results_name)
  # creating a temporary results data frame in the for loop memory
  tmp_res_df <- res %>% 
    # converting this to dataframe
    as.data.frame() %>%
    # Moving the gene_id into a column now called gene_id
    rownames_to_column("gene_id") %>%
    # Merge in g2s (by gene_id)
    merge(g2s) %>%
    # Add a column to track result name for i
    mutate(result_name = results_name)
  # This will keep adding new results (as rows) for each additional i in for loop
  res_df <- bind_rows(res_df, tmp_res_df)
  
}

# Let's take a look at what we got !
```
# Result: we now have all our deseq2 results in res_df object !

```{r checking NAs}
# Checking NAs
  sum(is.na(res_df$padj))
  
  # If we do want to clear them out:
  NoNA <- complete.cases(res_df)
  # WHAAATTTT WHY NO WORK
```

# saving results in res_df
```{r saving our results data frame}
save(res_df, file = "/scratch/Shares/rinnclass/MASTER_CLASS/STUDENTS/genehomies/RESULTS/HUMAN/time_point_res_df.RData")
# let's also save our DDS
save(dds, file = "/scratch/Shares/rinnclass/MASTER_CLASS/STUDENTS/genehomies/RESULTS/HUMAN/dds_time_point_human.RData")
```

# First let's filter to find genes that significantly changed across time points
For this we will use the filter function in baseR


```{r filter time point to padj < 0.05}

filtered_res_df <- res_df %>%
  filter(padj < 0.05)

# Wow we can see a major reduction in our dataframe

```

# Now let's see what happens when we filter for fold change across time as well 
```{r filtering Padj < 0.05 and LFC abs(1)}

filtered_res_df_2 <- filtered_res_df %>%
  filter(padj < 0.05, abs(log2FoldChange) > 1)

```

# How many unique genes does this represent?
```{r how many unique genes are in the significant results df?}

human_sig_genes <- unique(filtered_res_df_2$gene_id)

# cool so we have 669 genes that are significantly changing in at least one time point
```
# Result (again keeping track of good results)
# Result: There are X unique genes that change across time (padj < 0.05 log2 > 1)

# Lets do gene pathway analysis on the significant genes affected by dox across time
```{r getting gene list as data frame and then doing ontology analysis}
# printing out the gene_symbol column 
human_genes <- cat(paste(filtered_res_df_2$gene_name, collapse = "\n"))

# as data frame:
human_genes <- as.data.frame(filtered_res_df_2$gene_name, collapse = "\n")
# Let's make sure to only get the unique names
human_genes <- unique(human_genes)

# Now let's write this out and do gene enrichment analysis
write.table(human_genes["filtered_res_df_2$gene_name"], row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE, "/scratch/Shares/rinnclass/MASTER_CLASS/STUDENTS/genehomies/RESULTS/HUMAN/human_gene_names.csv")

save(filtered_res_df_2, file = "/scratch/Shares/rinnclass/MASTER_CLASS/STUDENTS/genehomies/RESULTS/HUMAN/filtered_res_df_2")
# copy and paste into EnrichR 
#https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/
